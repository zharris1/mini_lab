    "In this notebook we will explore methods of using logistic regression in `scikit-learn` and we will also investigate methods for gradient descent. Finally we will look at using support vector machines and investigate parameters of kernel functions. A basic understanding of `scikit-learn` is required to complete this notebook, but we start very basic. Note also that there are more efficient methods of separating testing and training data, but we will leave that for a later lecture. \n",

    "First let's load a dataset and prepare it for analysis. We will use pandas to load in data, and then prepare it for classification. We will be using the titanic dataset (a very modest sized data set of about 1000 instances) before loading a larger, more complicated dataset for gradient descent methods.\n",
